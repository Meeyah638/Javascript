            <p>Brendan Eich developed JavaScript, a computer language, in just ten days in May
                1995. <br>
                Initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, it finally became known as JavaScript. <br>
                It was designed for the client-side of websites to add dynamic and interactive elements <br>
                to static HTML pages.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. <br>
                It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. <br>
                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued <br>
                to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. <br>
                (Identical to ES5). Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 <br>
                Edition 1 (ES1).</p>

            <h2>INTRODUCTION TO VAR, LET AND CONST</h2>
            <p>Variable declaration in JavaScript is the process of creating a variable and <br>
                giving it a name so that it can be used to store a value. A variable is a named <br>
                container that holds a value, and can be used to store and manipulate data in a <br>
                program. "var", "let", and "const" are all used in JavaScript to declare variables. <br>
                However, there are many differences between let, var, and const in javascript in <br>
                terms of how they behave and how they should be used.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="vardef">
            <h2>What is var? <br></h2>
            <p> "var" is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared <br>
                with "var" have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within <br>
                the function in which they were declared. They also have "hoisting" behavior, <br>
                which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function, <br>
                regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, <br>
                variables declared with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.</p><br>

            <h4> Example: <br>
                var x = 5; <br>
                console.log(x); // Output: 5 <br>
                if (x > 0) { <br>
                var x = 10; <br>
                console.log(x); // Output: 10 <br>
                } <br>
                console.log(x); // Output: 10 <br><br>
            </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="letdef">
            <h2>What is let?<br></h2>
            <p>
                "let" was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to "var". <br>
                Variables declared with"let" have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible <br>
                within the block in which they were declared. They also have the concept of the temporal <br>
                dead zone, which means they are not accessible before they are declared. <br>
            </p>
            <h4>Example: <br>
                let y = 5;
                console.log(y); // Output: 5 <br>
                if (y > 0) { <br>
                let y = 10; <br>
                console.log(y); // Output: 10 <br>
                } <br>
                console.log(y); // Output: 5 <br><br>
            </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="constdef">
            <h2> What is const? <br></h2>
            <p> "const" was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables <br>
                that cannot be reassigned. This makes "const" variables useful for declaring <br>
                constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have a fixed value. <br>
                Like "let", "const" variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not <br>
                accessible before they are declared. However, it is recommended to use "let" <br>
                and "const" over "var" when declaring variables in JavaScript because they <br>
                have more predictable behavior, and "const" is the most recommended for <br>
                defining constant values that you don't expect to change.
            </p><br>
            <h4>Example:
                const pi = 3.14; <br>
                console.log(pi); // Output: 3.14 <br>
                pi = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

        <h2>Comparison operators</h2>

            equality or difference between variables or values.<br>
            Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to <br>

            Example:

        </p>

        <h4> In the example above, we check if the string 'yellow' is equal to the string 'green' and (&&) if 4 is

            The first expression is false, because the string 'yellow' is not the same (equal) as the string 'green'.
            <br>
            The second expression is true, because the number 4 is greater than or equal to 4. <br>

        <h4> Scope means where a variable can be accessed. Global scope → variable can be used anywhere. <br>

            Function scope → variable only works inside the function.Block scope (let and const) → <br>variable only
            works
            inside { }.
        </h4>

        <p> Example: <br>
            Global variable: let globalVar = "I am global" <br>
            Inside a function: <br>

            }
        </p>

        <h2> Hoisting</h2>

        <h4> JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope before running.

            With var, variables are hoisted but not their values.

            With let and const, variables are not accessible before declaration (Temporal Dead Zone).

            Functions declared with function are fully hoisted.</h4>

        <p> Example 1 (var):
            sayHi();

        </h4>
        <p> Example:
            function outer() {
