        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <h4>Variable declaration in JavaScript is the process of creating a variable and <br>
            giving it a name so that it can be used to store a value. A variable is a named <br>
            container that holds a value, and can be used to store and manipulate data in a <br>
            program. "var", "let", and "const" are all used in JavaScript to declare variables. <br>
            However, there are many differences between let, var, and const in javascript in <br>
            terms of how they behave and how they should be used.<br><br></h4>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">What is var? <br></p>
        <h4> "var" is the oldest way to declare a variable in JavaScript. Variables declared <br>
            with "var" have a function-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within <br>
            the function in which they were declared. They also have "hoisting" behavior, <br>
            which means they are accessible throughout the entire scope of the function, <br>
            regardless of where they were declared. However, because of its function-level scope, <br>
            variables declared with var can lead to unexpected behavior and are generally not recommended.</h4><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Example:</p>
        var x = 5; <br>
        console.log(x); // Output: 5 <br>
        if (x > 0) { <br>
        var x = 10; <br>
        console.log(x); // Output: 10 <br>
        } <br>
        console.log(x); // Output: 10 <br><br>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">What is let?<br></p>
        <h4>
            "let" was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as ES6) as an alternative to "var". <br>
            Variables declared with"let" have the block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible <br>
            within the block in which they were declared. They also have the concept of the temporal <br>
            dead zone, which means they are not accessible before they are declared. <br>
        </h4>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</p>
        let y = 5;
        console.log(y); // Output: 5 <br>
        if (y > 0) { <br>
        let y = 10; <br>
        console.log(y); // Output: 10 <br>
        } <br>
        console.log(y); // Output: 5 <br><br>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;"> What is const? <br></p>
        <h4> "const" was also introduced in ECMAScript 6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.
            This makes "const" variables useful for declaring constants, such as pi or the gravitational constant, which have
            a fixed value. Like "let", "const" variables have the block-level scope, and, they are not accessible before
            they are declared. However, it is recommended to use "let" and "const" over "var" when declaring variables
            in JavaScript because they have more predictable behavior, and "const" is the most recommended for defining
            constant values that you don't expect to change.
        </h4><br>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Example:</p>
        const pi = 3.14; <br>
        console.log(pi); // Output: 3.14 <br>
        pi = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
